Hi Ron,

I wish you a beautiful Sunday.
I can wish you that, I'm 79 years old. Hi

Attached are a few pictures of the problem with the pseudo signals.

Signal source: HP 8663A
Hardware RX: Proficio V5.1

Software (Copy from MSCC System)
MSCC: 08/15/2022 MS-sdr: 122.816 SDRcore-recv: 122.611 SDRcore-trans: 122.0
Professional: 122.1

Spectra were acquired on the 80m, 40m and 20m bands

Signal input level: partly -80dBm or -60dBm

Mode: USB, LSB, CW

File names of the images:
All file names start with "Spectrum" followed by [Band] [Mode] [Level].jpg

General remark:
The phenomenon of pseudo-signals (so far called "mirror".signal by me),
has ONE effect on the audio signal that can be heard in the speaker or earpiece.

If the RX is set to a frequency f. all signals with f - 24 kHz will fall into the reception filter and will therefore be audible.

A level non-calibrated signal with f=3776kHz produces an S-meter deflection of -94dBm.
If this signal is set to the frequency f=3752kc with the same output level, we get an S-meter reading of -100dBm.
Unwanted signal is received only 6dB smaller than the wanted signal.

The phenomenon shows no dependence as a function of the level. Level change 20dB
(Assessment only assessed visually from the Spectrums images.

The tested bands 80m, 40m and 20m show practically no difference in behavior

That's it. much luck
